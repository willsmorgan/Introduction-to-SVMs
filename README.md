# Introduction to SVMs


This repository is meant to be a quick intro to __Support Vector Machines__ (SVMs) for someone who already has a little bit of experience with Machine Learning techniques.

SVMs are directed learning models (we have labels a priori) used for classification and regression and made popular by Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonekis in the 60s. Soft margin classifiers and the use of kernels in SVMs are relatively new (last 20 years) discoveries.

In this presentation I will cover:

* Separating Hyperplanes
* The Maximal Margin Classifier
* Support Vector Classifiers
* Support Vector Machines with K = 2 classes

Some relevant topics that might be included in future updates to this repository are:

* SVM Regression
* SVM Classification with K > 2 classes

Many thanks to [Christopher Olah](http://colah.github.io/) for a couple of visualizations I took from his [Neural Networks, Manifolds, and Topology](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-03-NN-Manifolds-Topology/) blog post that really help with visualizing separation in larger feature spaces and Michael Hahsler for his [decision boundary plotting function in R](http://michael.hahsler.net/SMU/EMIS7332/R/viz_classifier.html). Any other resources I used are included in the citations.
